URL Shortening Service:-

- Design
    - POST Request :- Long URL, in Response, short URL is provided
    - GET Request :- Short URL, in Response, Long URL is given

- Requirement
    - Length of Short URL (How Much:- As Much Short As We Can) - 8 Characters by tj8765trymfr                                    5yyy5555555555555555555555555555555555555557d      fcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuLinkedin
        - Traffic - 10 Million URL Or Day (3650 Million URL/ Year)
        - For 100 Years, I should not face any issue - 3650*100 Million URL support --> 365*10^9 (Able to generate)
    - Characters that can be used
        - 0-9 | a-z | A-Z    -->    10 + 26 + 26   --->   62 Characters
        - Now to decide length of short URL
            - If we can character of Length 1 --> Only 62 URLs
            - If we can character of Length 2 --> Only 62^2 URLs
            - To fulfill our requirement --> we need to us at least 7 characters to go above 365*10^9

- To generate the required URL or say Hash Value, we have 2 methods
    - Hash Function - we do not use this - cause length of characters generate is more than required - If we try to pick the first 7 characters of every generated value, it may be duplicate right, because whole generated value are all different, but trimmed part can be duplicate
        - MD5 - 128 bit (16 Bytes) - Hash Function
            - In Hexadecimal - Base is 16
            - 1 Byte - 8 Bits - 2 Hexa Digits
            - 16 Bytes - 21 Hexadigits
            - MD5 can generate 32 Characters
            - Requirement is only 7 length
        - SHA1 - 160 Bit - 20 Bytes - 40 Hexa Digits
            - 40 Character Length
    - Base 62
        - Any decimal can be converted to any base
        - Here, base 62 - as we have been allowed 62 characters in the requirement (0-9,a-z,A-Z)

- We need an ID generator, which we will to convert using Base 62 to a unique value
- When w'/...////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// e convert an ID, the unique value needs to be of length ;pl l7hojjjje4yjfjbiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirkkkkkkkkkkkkk bds6j4umnnnmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm67
- 10 Million URL / Day :- cannot be done using single DB, we need to use sharded and distributed DB (with distributed computing)
    - We need to use multiple servers, 1 is not enough (single point of failure, and large DB capacity)
    - If multiple requests are going to different DBs, we must not generate same ID for both of them (synchronization problem)

- Problem of Generating Unique ID
    - We use Ticket Server (Centralized Auto Increment Service) - what is this fails, hence not reliable to solve synchronization problem
    - Snowflake (timestamp) :- TimeStamp + Machine ID + Sequence Number (This can be used, but youtuber preferred Zookeeper)
        - Even if 2 request come at same timestamp, Machine ID is differentlpo[ ]---------------p0

        - Twitter Uses it
    - Apache's Zookeeper :- Distributed Application can coordinate with each other reliably and perform task
        - Zookeeper has range for IDs which gets associated with each server, each range for a server, if one range is over, next or other works for that server
        - Every Server has its own range in Zookeeper

- Problem of Length of Generated ID
    - Minimum 7 character is needed
