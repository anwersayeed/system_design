- Scaling notifications is very hard.

- Suppose Sachin has 10M users, when he posts something, you need to send notification to 10M users and in realtime. (Impossible)

- YouTube implemented Bell Icon why?
    - So that, loyal followers should be prioritized when notifications are being sent. (Cannot send at once to all)
    - Now, it is okay if it takes time to send notifications to non bell icon pressed users
    - But those who pressed, they must get notifications with priority
