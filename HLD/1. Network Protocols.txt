############# Rules so that two systems can communicate with each other.

1. Learn About Network Protocols (TCP, Websocket, HTTP etc.)
    - Client-Server Vs Peer 2 Peer Architecture (Web Sockets)
    - HTTP vs TCP vs UDP vs FTP vs SMTP (POP, IMAP)

############# 7 Layers (Data travels from Sender in this order, Just reverse order for the receiver to get the data):-
Application Layer
↓
Presentation Layer
↓
Session Layer
↓
Transport Layer
↓
Network Layer
↓
Data Link Layer
↓
Physical Layer

We will read only 2 (Application Layer and Transport Layer)

- Application Layer
    - Client Server Protocol (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, Web Sockets)
        - One Way Communication
        - Client initiates and send requests to Server, Server only responds
        - Web Sockets are Bi-Directional, Both talk to each other (For Messaging Apps)
        - HTTP - Connection Oriented - 1 Connection Created - Access Web Pages (Inside Web Pages, we have hyper text where we jump from one page to another)
        - FTP - File Transfer Protocol - 2 Connection Maintained (Control Connection always connected and Data Connection may break and connect)
            - FTP is not secured - data is not encrypted
            - Hence, we use HTTPS - Secure Transfer Protocol
        - SMTP with IMAP or POP - (SMTP for sending the email, IMAP for accessing/ reading the email) - (User Agent sends messages to MTA client -> MTA Server to User Agent)
    - Peer to Peer Protocol  (WebRTC)
        - Suppose, we have server and multiple clients, all can talk to each other, even client can talk to client
        - Uses UDP to transfer data
        - Live Streaming, Video Calling

- Transport Layer and Network Layer
    - TCP/ IP - Data Packets through virtual connection, connection is maintained
         - Ordering Maintain - Each Data Packet is acknowledged
        - If acknowledgement does not come for a data packet from receiver - then data packet is sent again
    - UDP/ IP
        - No Connection is maintained
        - Various Small datagrams, and sent parallelly - multiple virtual connections, and not 1 connection
        - No ordering is done
        - Fast (No Ordering, No Acknowledgement, No Connection maintained)
        - Video Calling, Live Streaming
        - WebRTC uses UDP to transfer data
